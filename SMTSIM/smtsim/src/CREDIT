               The SMTSIM Multithreading Simulator

Written by Dean M. Tullsen (tullsen@cs.ucsd.edu) with significant
assistance by Jack Lo, E. Gun Sirer and (unbeknownst to him) Jim Larus.

Although Susan Eggers, Hank Levy, Joel Emer, and Rebecca Stamm never
actually got their hands dirty in the code, they each influenced
pieces of it.

This code is provided "as is" with no promise of support whatsoever,
but please do send bug reports (especially solved bugs!) to
tullsen@cs.ucsd.edu.
